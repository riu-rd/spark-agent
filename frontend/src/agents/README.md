# TRYBE AI Agents

This directory is reserved for AI agent integration components and logic.

## Status: Ready for Integration

The frontend has been prepared for AI agent integration with the following capabilities:

### Transaction Management
- **Transaction Manager**: `../utils/transactionManager.js` handles both demo and agent transactions
- **Real-time Updates**: Components automatically update when agents add new transactions
- **Agent Transaction API**: Ready for agents to create, update, and manage transactions

### Agent Integration Points
1. **Transaction Creation**: Agents can call `addAgentTransaction()` to create new transactions
2. **Status Updates**: Agents can update transaction statuses via `updateTransactionStatus()`
3. **Real-time UI**: All components subscribe to transaction updates automatically

### Demo Features
- Mock transactions are maintained for demonstration
- "Simulate AI" button in the UI shows how agent transactions will appear
- Agent-assisted transactions are visually marked with bot icons

### Planned Agents:
- **Discrepancy Detector** - Monitors transaction anomalies
- **Risk Predictor** - Forecasts potential transaction issues  
- **Auto Reconciler** - Handles automated transaction retries and reversals
- **User Notifier** - Manages user communications and alerts
- **Ops Assistant** - Handles escalations and human intervention
- **Trust Manager** - Central orchestrator for all AI agents

### Next Steps for Agent Integration
1. Add agent communication layer
2. Implement agent decision-making logic
3. Connect to external APIs and services
4. Add agent-specific UI components

## Current Architecture

```
Frontend (React) ←→ Transaction Manager ←→ AI Agents (To be added)
                           ↓
                    Real-time UI Updates
```

The transaction management system is designed to seamlessly handle both user-initiated and agent-initiated transactions, providing a foundation for intelligent banking assistance.
